          <h2>üë©‚Äçüíª Who am I?</h2>
          <p>Hello! I'm Mariana</p>
          <p>
            I'm currently in my ninth semester of the Computer Engineering
            program at the Faculty of Engineering, Autonomous University of
            Mexico (UNAM).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about data analysis and artificial intelligence, with
            a keen interest in exploring their applications to solve real-world
            problems.

          <h2> What do I like?</h2>
          <p>
            I am deeply passionate about my career and new technologies,
            especially in the areas of data analysis and understanding how we
            can leverage data for practical applications. Currently, I primarily
            use Python due to its simplicity, but I am transitioning to R to
            explore its advanced capabilities in specific fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I currently use Windows as my operating system, I am in the
            process of switching to Linux, as it offers significant advantages
            in areas such as system management and development environments.
          </p>

          <h2>üéÆ What are my hobbies?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning:</strong>
              <p>
                My greatest hobby is learning. I am constantly exploring new
                technologies, such as Docker, and expanding my knowledge in
                different areas, including languages like French and the
                development of soft skills.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Series:</strong>
              <p>
                I enjoy watching series, especially animes with deep and
                meaningful narratives. I‚Äôm particularly drawn to series and
                mangas that explore concepts like databases, statistics, and
                cryptography.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Video Games:</strong>
              <p>
                I have a passion for story-driven or open-world video games.
                Some of my favorites include The Sims, Roblox, and VRChat, as
                they allow me to explore immersive worlds and unique
                experiences.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Music:</strong>
              <p>
                Music is another passion of mine, particularly genres that tell
                a story or feature string instruments. I find that music with
                such depth adds an emotional layer to the listening experience.
              </p>
